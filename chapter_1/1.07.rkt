; The good-enough? test used in computing square roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of very small numbers.
; Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are almost always performed with limited precision. This makes our test inadequate for very large numbers.
; Explain these statements
; 1) For small numbers, the precision of .001 might be too large
; 2) For large numbers the precision of .001 might be too small
